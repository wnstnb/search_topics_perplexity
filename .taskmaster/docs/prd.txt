# Typefully API Integration PRD

## Project Overview
Integrate Typefully API into the search_topics_perplexity project to enable automated Twitter/X content publishing and management. This integration will allow the system to programmatically create, schedule, and monitor social media content through Typefully's robust API.

## Core Objectives
- Enable automated social media content publishing
- Provide scheduling capabilities for optimal posting times
- Monitor published content performance and engagement
- Integrate seamlessly with existing agent architecture
- Maintain compliance with X automation rules

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication System
- Implement secure API key management for Typefully authentication
- Support multiple Twitter/X accounts through account switching
- Handle API key rotation and validation
- Store credentials securely using environment variables

### 2. Draft Creation & Management
- Create drafts programmatically from generated content
- Support thread creation with automatic content splitting
- Enable manual thread formatting using 4 consecutive newlines
- Implement threadify feature for automatic tweet splitting
- Handle rich text formatting and media attachments

### 3. Scheduling System
- Schedule drafts for specific dates and times (ISO format)
- Implement "next-free-slot" scheduling for optimal timing
- Support bulk scheduling operations
- Handle timezone conversions and scheduling conflicts
- Provide scheduling validation and error handling

### 4. Content Monitoring
- Retrieve recently scheduled drafts
- Fetch recently published content
- Monitor notifications (replies, comments, engagement)
- Track auto-retweet and auto-plug performance
- Generate publishing success/failure reports

### 5. Advanced Features
- Auto-retweet functionality for content amplification
- Auto-plug integration for consistent branding
- Content filtering and categorization
- Draft sharing capabilities with share URLs
- Notification management and read status tracking

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration Specifications
- Base URL: https://api.typefully.com/v1
- Authentication: X-API-KEY header with Bearer token
- Rate limiting compliance and retry logic
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Response validation and data sanitization

### Endpoints to Implement
1. POST /v1/drafts/ - Create drafts
2. GET /v1/drafts/recently-scheduled/ - Fetch scheduled content
3. GET /v1/drafts/recently-published/ - Fetch published content
4. GET /v1/notifications/ - Monitor notifications
5. POST /v1/notifications/mark-all-read/ - Manage notifications

### Integration Points
- Extend existing agents (search_agent.py, twitter_agent.py)
- Add new typefully_agent.py for dedicated API handling
- Update config.py for API configuration management
- Integrate with main.py workflow orchestration

### Data Models
- Draft model with content, scheduling, and metadata
- Notification model for engagement tracking
- Account model for multi-account management
- Publishing result model for success/failure tracking

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time < 2 seconds for standard operations
- Support for concurrent draft creation (up to 10 simultaneous)
- Efficient content batching for bulk operations
- Memory-efficient handling of large content volumes

### Reliability
- 99.5% uptime for API integrations
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

### Security
- Secure API key storage and transmission
- Input validation for all content and parameters
- Protection against content injection attacks
- Audit logging for all API operations

### Compliance
- Adherence to X automation rules and guidelines
- Rate limiting to prevent account suspension
- Content validation for policy compliance
- Proper attribution and disclosure for automated content

## Success Metrics
- Successful integration with < 5% API error rate
- Automated publishing accuracy > 98%
- Average scheduling latency < 30 seconds
- User satisfaction rating > 4.5/5 for automation features

## Dependencies
- Existing project structure (agents/, config.py, utils.py)
- Python requests library for HTTP operations
- Environment variable management system
- Logging framework for operation tracking

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing codebase
- Follow X platform automation guidelines
- Respect Typefully API rate limits
- Minimize external dependencies

## Risks & Mitigation
- API rate limiting: Implement intelligent queuing system
- Account suspension: Strict compliance with automation rules
- API changes: Version management and backward compatibility
- Content quality: Validation and review processes
